# Hello! 👋 I'm Żaneta

I'm a Computer Science engineering student (graduation: 2026), focusing on backend development with .NET/C#.  
Currently, I'm actively looking for a **remote internship** to gain hands-on experience and grow my skills through real-world projects.

## 💻 Technologies I work with:
- C#, .NET 6/7/9 (currently exploring .NET 9 Preview)
- ASP.NET Core (MVC, Web API)
- Entity Framework Core
- SQL Server / SQLite
- Git & GitHub
- Visual Studio
- WordPress (technical & organizational side)

## 🧠 What I can do:
- Build CRUD applications (console and web)
- Design databases and connect them with .NET apps
- Follow good coding practices (clean code, separation of concerns, design patterns)
- Work independently and organize tasks – I have experience as an executive assistant

## 🚀 Projects on my GitHub:
- [`PickupPointApp`](https://github.com/ZanetaBor/PickupPointApp.git) – Pickup point management app: Backend API (ASP.NET Core, C#); Frontend (React, JavaScript); Desktop Client (WinForms, C#)
- [`Memo`](https://github.com/ZanetaBor/Memo.git) – Interactive memory game using C# and WPF
- [`AR-GAZ.pl`](https://ar-gaz.pl) – A business website built with WordPress
- [`To_do_when`](https://github.com/ZanetaBor/To_do_when) – TO DO app with Node.js, fetch API, and Cypress tests
- [`Pasjans`](https://github.com/ZanetaBor/pasjans) – A solitaire card game using C# and WPF (work in progress)

> More projects coming soon – I'm constantly learning and building new things!

## 🎯 My goals:
- Join a company that supports junior developers and offers a remote internship
- Learn advanced ASP.NET (Identity, Dependency Injection, authorization)
- Gain experience working on real-world projects with a team

## 🤝 Are you looking for someone who:
✅ Is highly motivated to learn  
✅ Can work independently and remotely  
✅ Has technical foundations and wants to grow  

➡️ That’s me! 😄
